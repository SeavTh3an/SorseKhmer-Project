📌 Project Overview

Sorse Khmer is a Unity-based educational typing game designed to help players practice typing in the Khmer language.
The game combines learning with action-based gameplay, where players must type Khmer words correctly to defeat approaching enemies.

This project was developed as a final project under academic guidance and focuses on improving typing accuracy, language familiarity, and reaction speed.

🎯 Game Concept

Khmer words appear above enemies

Players type the word using the keyboard

If the word is typed correctly, the text turns green and the player attacks the enemy

If the player types incorrectly or too slowly, the enemy reaches and damages the player

The game ends when the player is defeated
